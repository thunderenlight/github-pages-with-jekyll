## New Year who Dis?

Many thanks and gratitude to the new year birds outside my window. I may consider using this space as a #100 days of code journal. I did learn
another facet of JavaScript' await async properties and how they do more in relationship to .then and catch values.
Will edit later or decide how to integrate with my former jekyll blog site.

It seems doing things manually can help with the comprehension stabilizing.
